Órdenes de intérprete que coinciden con la palabra `cd*'

cd: cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]
    Cambia el directorio de trabajo del intérprete de comandos.
    
    Cambia el directorio actual a DIR.  El DIR por defecto es el valor de la
    variable HOME del intérprete.
    
    La variable CDPATH define la ruta de búsqueda para el directorio que contiene
    DIR.  Los nombres de directorio alternativos en CDPATH se separan con dos puntos (:).
    Un nombre de directorio nulo es equivalente al directorio actual.  Si DIR comienza
    con un barra (/), entonces CDPATH no se usa.
    
    Si no se encuentra el directorio y se establece la opción del intérprete «cdable_vars»,
    se asume que la palabra es un nombre de variable.  Si esa variable tiene un valor,
    se utiliza ese valor para DIR.
    
    Opciones:
      -L	fuerza a seguir enlaces simbólicos: resuelve enlaces
    		simbólicos en DIR después de procesar instancias de «..»
      -P	usa la estructura del directorio físico sin seguir
    		enlaces simbólicos: resuelve enlaces simbólicos en DIR antes
    		de procesar instancias de «..»
      -e	si se proporciona la opción -P, y el directorio de trabajo
    		actual no se puede determinar correctamente, sale con
    		un estado distinto de cero
      -@	en sistemas que lo soportan, presenta un archivo con atributos
    		extendidos como un directorio que contiene los atributos de archivo
    
    Lo predeterminado es seguir enlaces simbólicos, como si «-L» se hubiera especificado.
    Se procesa «..» eliminando el componente del nombre de ruta inmediatamente anterior
    detrás de una barra o al comienzo de DIR.
    
    Estado de salida:
    Devuelve 0 si se ha cambiado el directorio, y si $PWD se estableció correctamente al
    utilizar -P; de otra manera es distinto de cero.
